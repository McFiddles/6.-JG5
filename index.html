                Welcome to our new website and our 'new' squadron. Many of you will remember us from our JG5 label that we've previously used in IL-2 (FB, PF, 1946) as we've been using this name since 1999. But with the rise of IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad we noticed a significant increase in the usage of the JG5 label. To ensure people are still able to identify us as 'that JG5 squad', we chose to adapt to the current theatre and opt for a new name.
            </p>   
            <p>
                We might have a new name, but we are still all original JG5 members. We will continu upholding our original values and are always open for input from other squadrons.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're more than welcome to browse around on our website to get to know us, our server and the missions we plan on hosting. Do visit the forum if you have a proposition for us or if you would just like to ask us something. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We hope to see you in the sky fighting alongside or against us!
            </p>
